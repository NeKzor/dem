# SignOn & Packet

Packets contain simulated information about a session. A SignOn message is the same as a Packet message but only
appears once at the very beginning to indicate that the server is ready.

## MaxSplitScreenClients (MSSC)

This value is most likely 1 for single-player-only games but 2 for multiplayer games which support split screen mode
(Portal 2, CS:GO etc.). Although it can be misleading if a game does not have multiplayer mode but yet supports this
feature. The console command `maxplayers` can be executed in the developer console and should help to find out the exact
value for a specific game.
